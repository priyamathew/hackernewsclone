stuff to ajax

- show/hide update user attributes (on profile page)

- login button

- add new post to dom (at top)
- add new comment to dom (at bottom)



















refactor : 
  Doesn't make sense to create a post vote and increment it
  Need the points from the total votes

  This should come from post.post_votes.count
